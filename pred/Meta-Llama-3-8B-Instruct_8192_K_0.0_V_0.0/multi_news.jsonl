Additionally, the smoke-exposed bacteria became more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls, and were better at invading human cells.\n\nThe researchers also discovered that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited.

At Marden Henge, a 4,300-year-old house has been uncovered, which is believed to be one of the best-preserved from the period ever found in the UK. The house, which was once part of a massive enclosure, has produced finds including flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, and a Roman brooch. Analysis of the site suggests that it was used for great gatherings and feasts, rather than as a permanent residence.\n\nThe house is part of the Marden Henge, a giant ditch and bank enclosure that is one of the largest prehistoric monuments in the country. The site is believed to have been used to show off wealth and power, and its size and complexity suggest that it was an important center of activity in the Neolithic period.\n\nIn a separate discovery, a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton, believed to be that of a child, has been unearthed at Wilsford Henge. The skeleton was found lying in a foetal position and wearing an amber necklace, and scientists will conduct further analysis to learn more about the child's life and death.\n\nThe discoveries are part of a three-year excavation project in the Vale of Pewsey, which aims to gain a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge. The project is a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum.\n\nThe public will have the opportunity to visit the sites and learn more about the discoveries at an open day event, which will feature finds on display, tours, and activities.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland. A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary. So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says.

The Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA) has reported a 300% increase in website traffic and a surge in permit requests for long-distance hikes. The trail, which spans 2,650 miles from California to Washington, has traditionally been a relatively quiet and remote route, but the increased attention has brought more hikers to the trail.\n\nWhile the PCTA is pleased with the increased interest in the trail, there are concerns about overcrowding and the potential impact on the environment and local communities. The PCTA has implemented a permit system to manage the number of hikers on the trail, with a daily quota of 50 permits per day. However, this has not been enough to prevent overcrowding, with some areas of the trail reaching capacity.\n\nThe increased popularity of the trail has also led to concerns about the financial and environmental impact of the hikers. The PCTA has reported a significant increase in helicopter evacuations and searches, and there are concerns about the degradation of the trail and surrounding environment. Some hikers have also reported negative experiences, including encounters with aggressive wildlife and litter and human waste on the trail.\n\nDespite these challenges, many hikers are drawn to the PCT for its natural beauty and sense of adventure. The trail offers a unique opportunity for hikers to challenge themselves and connect with nature, and many hikers report feeling a sense of transformation and personal growth after completing the hike.\n\nIn response to the increased popularity of the trail, the PCTA has launched a campaign to promote responsible hiking practices, including the hashtag #responsiblywild. The campaign encourages hikers to respect the trail and surrounding environment, and to take steps to minimize their impact on the trail and local communities.\n\nOverall, the increased popularity of the Pacific Crest Trail is a mixed blessing, bringing both benefits and challenges to the trail and its users.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

The New York Times describes Wright as a \"rebel,\" both hosts as \"irreverent and eccentric,\" and the recipes as \"sometimes confounding.\" Wright's eclectic working life also included stints as a cook, an author, and a cookbook shop manager; she also ran a catering business, was a guild butcher, and once worked on a yacht in the Caribbean. In fact, she recently said, \"I've had a fantastic life and I've done everything I could have wanted to do and more.\" It wasn't until her 40s, after she'd recovered from alcoholism, that she got into cooking seriously. As for the perhaps-controversial title of the show that brought her fame? \"If you're fat you're fat,\" she once said. \"I hate this modern-day political correctness, that you don't call things by their proper name.\" Her agent remembers Wright similarly in a statement: \"Loved dearly by her friends and many fans all over the world, Clarissa was utterly non-PC and fought for what she believed in, always, with no thought to her own personal cost.\" There's no word on Wright's cause of death, but the Guardian reports that she had been undergoing treatment at a hospital since the beginning of the year."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2870}

The tax, which adds 1.75 cents per ounce to sugary drinks, has been blamed for driving up prices and causing customers to shop elsewhere. Costco, a popular retailer, has seen a 34% decline in sales of affected beverages in its Cook County locations, with customers opting to buy the same products at its stores outside the city limits. The tax has also been criticized for being regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families who rely on sugary drinks.\n\nThe tax was implemented to reduce sugar consumption and raise revenue for the city, but critics argue that it is not an effective way to achieve these goals. A study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University found that soda taxes do not reduce sugar consumption and can actually drive it up by making consumers seek out cheaper, less healthy alternatives. The tax has also been criticized for being inconsistent, exempting sugary drinks that list milk as their primary ingredient, such as flavored coffee beverages.\n\nThe tax has also been met with opposition from the beverage industry, which has spent millions fighting the tax. In Cook County, Illinois, the tax was repealed just two months after its implementation, with retailers and restaurants celebrating the victory. The repeal was seen as a major blow to the tax, which was touted as a way to reduce sugar consumption and raise revenue for the county.\n\nIn Seattle, the tax has been met with similar opposition, with some calling for its repeal.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

The researchers analyzed data from over 64,000 children and their mothers, and found that women who took acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy had a higher risk of having children with ADHD-like behaviors.\n\nThe study's authors suggest that acetaminophen may increase the risk of ADHD by interfering with maternal hormones that are critical for fetal brain development. However, the study did not find a cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD, and the authors emphasized that the results do not mean that pregnant women should never take acetaminophen. Instead, they recommend that women avoid taking the drug frequently or for extended periods until more studies have been done.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked concerns among experts, with some warning that the results may be misinterpreted and lead to unnecessary worry among pregnant women.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business.

The spacecraft will make 24 close flybys of the sun, with its closest approach being 3.7 million miles from the sun's surface.

The discovery was made by a team of researchers at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), led by Mike Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in reclassifying Pluto as a dwarf planet in 2006.\n\nThe team used mathematical and computer modeling to identify the planet's existence, and believe it will be detected via telescope within the next five years. Brown and his colleague, Konstantin Batygin, have published their findings in the Astronomical Journal and are confident that the discovery will be confirmed.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked renewed debate about the definition of a planet, with some arguing that Pluto should be reinstated as a planet. However, Brown and his team believe that the discovery of Eris, a dwarf planet similar to Pluto, in 2005, led to the International Astronomical Union's decision to reclassify Pluto, and that the same criteria should apply to any new discoveries.\n\nBrown, who has received hate mail and criticism for his role in demoting Pluto, believes that the controversy will eventually die down and that the discovery of Planet Nine will be a significant advancement in our understanding of the solar system. He argues that the discovery of a new type of object in the outer solar system is more exciting than the debate over Pluto's status.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also sparked excitement among scientists, with some predicting that it could be a major breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

{"pred": "A recent paper published on arXiv.org has revived the concept of a Russian astronomer's proposal for a three-step plan to dominate the universe, which involves harvesting energy from stars. According to the paper's author, Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, harvesting energy from distant stars is not only a way to increase a civilization's resources but also the only way to prevent the ever-expanding universe from leaving a civilization alone in the vastness of space.\n\nThe paper suggests that advanced civilizations would capture stars from other galaxies, reel them in, and harvest their energy before they become inaccessible forever. This would require a massive network of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, to surround the star and beam energy back to the home planet. The paper also proposes that these civilizations would be able to detect the unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres has been explored in science fiction, with authors such as Olaf Stapledon and Larry Niven featuring similar structures in their works. Physicist Freeman Dyson also proposed the idea in a scientific paper in 1960, suggesting that advanced civilizations would re-engineer their solar systems to capture their star's energy.\n\nThe paper's author, Dan Hooper, notes that humans are still at Level I of Kardashev's scale, which measures the energy consumption of a society, and that it may take thousands or millions of years for us to reach Level III, where we would be able to harness the energy of a galaxy. However, the paper suggests that there could be alien civilizations that are already at Level III, and that we may be able to detect their presence by looking for unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away.\n\nOverall, the paper provides a new perspective on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) and the possibility of detecting advanced alien civilizations.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

In Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin, researchers have uncovered evidence of advanced stone tools and pigment use dating back 320,000 years, challenging previous assumptions about the emergence of modern human behavior.\n\nThe findings suggest that early humans in Africa were capable of complex behaviors, such as long-distance trade and exchange of raw materials, and the development of symbolic expression through art and ornamentation. The discovery of obsidian tools and pigment, which were brought from distant locations, indicates a sophisticated understanding of space and time, as well as the ability to transmit technological skills through generations.\n\nThe research also suggests that the \"human revolution\" that led to the emergence of modern human behavior may not have occurred as suddenly as previously thought. Instead, the development of complex behaviors may have been a gradual process that began earlier than previously believed.\n\nThe discoveries in Olorgesailie Basin provide evidence of technological innovation and cultural complexity in early human societies, and challenge the idea that modern human behavior emerged suddenly around 40,000-50,000 years ago.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

However, thanks to previous operations and a hearing aid, he has gradually been able to hear. The surgery, led by consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon Neil Bulstrode, involved harvesting cartilage from Kieran's ribs and shaping it into frameworks for his ears. The ears were then grafted onto his head, and the skin was shaped to fit the contours of the new ears.\n\nThe surgery was primarily cosmetic, but it brings significant psychological benefits, as it can improve a child's confidence and self-esteem.

{"pred": "Here is a one-page summary of the news:\n\nThe Gibson Guitar Corporation, a renowned instrument manufacturer, has been raided by the US Justice Department for allegedly trafficking in illegally obtained wood. The raids, which took place in Tennessee, are believed to be related to the Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law that was amended in 2008 to include plants as well as animals. The law requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain all the way to the trees.\n\nGibson's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, claims that the company has been unfairly targeted and that the government has not provided sufficient evidence of wrongdoing. He also argues that the company has been injured by the raids, which have shut down production and caused millions of dollars in losses.\n\nHowever, the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has concluded that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood from Madagascar, a country with a history of illegal logging. The EIA's director, Andrea Johnson, says that Gibson was aware of the risks involved and made a decision to source wood despite knowing that there was a ban on exports of ebony and rosewood.\n\nGibson has denied these allegations, claiming that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with US and Malagasy law. The company has presented documents to support its claim and says that the recent raid seized legally obtained wood from India.\n\nThe Lacey Act has also raised concerns among guitar builders and dealers, who are worried about the retroactive nature of the law and the potential for being forced to prove the provenance of wood they acquired decades ago. Some have even warned clients to be wary of traveling abroad with old guitars, as the law requires owners to account for every wooden part of their instruments when re-entering the US.\n\nThe government's efforts to enforce the Lacey Act have been met with criticism from some, who argue that the law is burdensome and may have unintended consequences. However, the EIA's Andrea Johnson defends the law, saying that it is necessary to reduce illegal logging and promote responsible wood sourcing.\n\nThe case against Gibson is ongoing, with the company awaiting charges and a day in court. The outcome of the case will likely have significant implications for the music industry and the way that wood is sourced and traded globally.", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week. NPR aired the complicated story involving the 100-year old Lacey Act, which prohibits imports of endangered species, including plants, into the US. No formal charges have been pressed, but it appears the issue lies with Gibson possibly importing banned Madagascar ebony. Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood. However the story plays out, many are frustrated with the retroactive aspect of the law. \"It's a nightmare,\" says a dealer. \"I can't help it if they used Brazilian rosewood on almost every guitar made prior to 1970.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 1352}

{"pred": "NASA scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery about the history of Mars, revealing that a massive ancient ocean once covered nearly half of the planet's northern hemisphere. The ocean, which was at least a mile deep in some areas, was a significant portion of the planet's surface, equivalent to the Atlantic Ocean covering the Earth. This finding challenges previous theories that Mars was a dry and barren planet, and instead suggests that it was once a warm and wet world with a habitable environment.\n\nThe discovery was made by analyzing the Martian atmosphere and the ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in the water vapor. The team found that the Martian atmosphere has a higher proportion of deuterium than Earth's, indicating that Mars has lost a significant amount of water over time. By calculating the rate at which the ordinary hydrogen has been leaking into space, the scientists were able to estimate the amount of water that once existed on Mars.\n\nThe results suggest that the ancient ocean would have covered the entire planet to a depth of about 137 meters, with the northern hemisphere being the most likely location. This finding has significant implications for the search for life on Mars, as it suggests that the planet may have had a habitable environment for a longer period than previously thought.\n\nThe discovery also raises the possibility that life may have existed on Mars in the past, and that the planet may have been capable of supporting life for millions of years. The European Space Agency's Exomars rover, set to launch in 2018, will search for signs of life on Mars by analyzing the chemical composition of the Martian soil.\n\nThe study's findings are supported by previous research, including NASA's Curiosity rover, which has found evidence of ancient lakes and rivers on Mars.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "A new study suggests that dinosaurs may not have roared like they do in movies, but instead made sounds similar to those of birds. The research, published in the journal Evolution, found that many birds make sounds with their closed mouths, rather than their open beaks, and that this behavior has evolved independently at least 16 times in different bird species. The study's authors suggest that this behavior may have also been present in some non-avian dinosaurs, particularly those with large body sizes.\n\nThe study's findings are based on an analysis of the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization in birds and other reptilian groups. The researchers found that 52 out of 208 bird species use this behavior, and that it is more common in larger birds. They also found that the ability to make closed-mouth vocalizations is associated with large body size, which is likely due to the physical challenges of inflating an elastic cavity.\n\nThe study's authors suggest that some dinosaurs may have made similar sounds, perhaps during mating displays. While there is no direct fossil evidence to support this, the study offers clues about the sounds that extinct early avian species and their dinosaur ancestors may have produced. The researchers plan to continue their study by integrating information from fossils, experimental physiology, gene expression, and sound modeling to better understand the sounds of extinct species.\n\nIn related news, a sound designer who worked on the movie Jurassic Park revealed that the sounds of the dinosaurs in the film were created by combining sounds from various animals, including tortoises, horses, and geese. The designer, Gary Rydstrom, used a variety of techniques to create the sounds, including slowing down and speeding up recordings of animal noises.\n\nOverall, the study and the sound design techniques used in Jurassic Park suggest that dinosaurs may have made sounds that were different from the traditional roar, and that their vocalizations may have been more complex and varied than previously thought.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure?

Sources have told the media that the couple were found hanging near an indoor pool in the basement of their Toronto mansion.

{"pred": "Egypt is holding its final round of parliamentary elections, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to consolidate its gains and potentially win a majority of seats. The party has already won a significant number of seats in the first two rounds of voting, and is expected to do well in the nine provinces voting in the final round. The Brotherhood has played down its electoral strength, but some analysts believe it could win more than half of the seats.\n\nMeanwhile, the trial of former President Hosni Mubarak has resumed, with the chief prosecutor accusing Mubarak of imposing \"tyrannical rule\" and devoting the last decade of his rule to ensuring his son Gamal would succeed him. Mubarak is charged with complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the uprising that forced him from office, and could face the death penalty if convicted. His two sons, Alaa and Gamal, are also on trial, facing corruption charges.\n\nThe elections and Mubarak's trial come amid growing opposition to the ruling military council, which has been criticized for its handling of the transition to democracy. The council has said it will not cede power until presidential elections are held by the end of June, but protesters are demanding an earlier transfer of power.\n\nThe economy is also struggling, with foreign-currency reserves declining by 44% and the stock market losing 49% of its value last year. The country is facing a difficult period of adjustment, and the new parliament will have to navigate a complex political landscape to address the country's challenges.\n\nThe Brotherhood has said it intends to form a coalition government, but winning a clear majority would enable it to govern without forming a coalition. The ultraconservative Salafis, who have won a significant number of seats, are also expected to play a key role in the new parliament.\n\nThe trial of Mubarak and his associates is expected to continue for several days, with the prosecution presenting its case against the former president and his sons. The outcome of the trial is uncertain, but it is seen as a key test of the country's commitment to accountability and the rule of law.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
{"pred": "**Car Suspended from Telephone Pole after Driver Reacts to GPS Directions**\n\nA bizarre incident occurred in Mendon, Vermont, on Wednesday evening when a Toyota Corolla was suspended from a telephone guy wire after the driver, Nabila Altahan, reacted too quickly to a GPS system's directions to turn around. According to police, Altahan was driving westbound on Route 4 when the GPS device instructed her to turn around, as she had passed her intended destination. In a swift reaction, Altahan left the road and the car ended up suspended on the guy wire, supported by a telephone pole across from Sugar & Spice Restaurant.\n\nFortunately, Altahan and her passenger were not injured in the incident.
