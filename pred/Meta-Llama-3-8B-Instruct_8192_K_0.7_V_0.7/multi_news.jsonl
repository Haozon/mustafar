Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

Davis also felt the fetus “tremble violently\" in the womb, \"as if someone were applying an electric shock to her, and I knew then what I needed to do. She was suffering.\" Her doctor \"quieted\" the unborn child's heart and delivered her by C-section. Davis and her husband had Tate baptized.

The tax, which adds a 1.75-cent-per-ounce fee to sweetened beverages, was touted as a way to reduce sugar consumption and raise revenue for the city. However, the tax has been met with widespread criticism and resistance from businesses and consumers alike.\n\nOne of the main concerns is that the tax is regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families who rely on sugary drinks as a source of hydration and nutrition. Additionally, the tax has been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability, with some arguing that the revenue generated from the tax will not be used effectively to address the city's health and wellness goals.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its impact on small businesses, particularly those that rely heavily on sugary drinks. Many have reported significant losses in sales and revenue, which could have long-term consequences for their viability.\n\nIn related news, the city of Chicago has repealed its own sweetened beverage tax, which was implemented in 2017. The tax was met with widespread opposition from businesses and consumers, and was ultimately repealed after a court ruling declared it unconstitutional.\n\nIn other news, a bill has been introduced in the Washington state legislature to impose a similar tax on sugary drinks statewide.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

The planet, dubbed \"Planet Nine,\" is believed to be a gas giant, about 10 times the size of Earth, and orbits the sun at a distance of about 200 astronomical units (AU). The discovery was made by a team of scientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE).\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine was announced in a paper published in the journal Nature on August 24, 2016. The paper, titled \"A massive planet in the distant future orbit,\" was written by a team of scientists led by Dr. Mike Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at Caltech.\n\nAccording to the paper, the team used data from the SDSS and WISE to identify a large number of small, icy bodies in the outer reaches of the solar system. By analyzing the orbits of these bodies, the team was able to infer the presence of a large, unseen planet that was perturbing their orbits.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has significant implications for our understanding of the solar system. It suggests that there may be many more large, undiscovered planets in the outer reaches of the solar system, and that the solar system may be much more complex and dynamic than previously thought.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also sparked renewed interest in the search for other undiscovered planets in the solar system. Astronomers are now using a variety of methods to search for these planets, including the study of the orbits of small bodies in the Kuiper Belt and the analysis of the light curves of distant stars.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of Planet Nine is a significant breakthrough in the field of astronomy, and it has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the solar system.", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

The study, published in the journal Cancer, analyzed data from over 258,000 patients with colorectal cancer and found that 15% of them were under the age of 50.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, noted that the findings suggest that the current guidelines for colon cancer screening, which recommend starting at age 50, may need to be reevaluated. The study found that younger patients were more likely to have advanced-stage disease and were more likely to receive aggressive treatment, including surgery and radiation therapy.\n\nThe study also found that younger patients were more likely to have a better prognosis than older patients, with a five-year survival rate of 95% compared to 85% for patients over 50. The study's findings suggest that younger patients may be more likely to receive aggressive treatment and may have a better prognosis than older patients.\n\nThe study's authors noted that the increasing incidence of colon cancer in younger patients may be due to a combination of factors, including changes in diet and lifestyle, as well as genetic predisposition.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

In a review titled \"Will Smith just stole $12 from your pocket,\" he argues Focus is \"ridiculous in every detail. It's a movie with no truth that teaches nothing and shows nothing, that has only its audacity to recommend it.\" Nicky and Jess lack \"impact,\" partly because \"Smith is not a strong leading man,\" he says.

The study, published in the journal Evolution, analyzed the vocalizations of birds and found that many species use a type of vocalization called \"closed-mouth vocalization,\" where they make sounds by inflating their esophagus rather than using their vocal cords.\n\nThe study, led by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, analyzed the vocalizations of over 200 bird species and found that many of them use closed-mouth vocalizations, which involve inflating the esophagus to produce sound. The researchers suggest that this type of vocalization may have evolved in birds as a way to communicate with each other, and that it may have been present in dinosaurs as well.\n\nThe study also found that the size of the bird's body affects the type of vocalization it produces. Larger birds tend to produce lower-pitched sounds, while smaller birds produce higher-pitched sounds. This suggests that the size of the bird may play a role in determining the type of vocalization it produces.\n\nThe study also found that the type of vocalization used by a bird can depend on its environment. For example, birds that live in dense forests may use a different type of vocalization than birds that live in open grasslands.\n\nThe researchers suggest that the study of bird vocalizations can provide insights into the evolution of language and communication in humans.
